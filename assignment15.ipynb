    "#APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.\n",
    "#API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.\n",

    "#Many legacy systems may still adhere to SOAP, while REST came later and is often viewed as a faster alternative in web-based scenarios. REST is a set of guidelines that offers flexible implementation, whereas SOAP is a protocol with specific requirements like XML messaging.REST APIs are lightweight, making them ideal for newer contexts like the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile application development, and serverless computing. SOAP web services offer built-in security and transaction compliance that align with many enterprise needs, but that also makes them heavier. Additionally, many public APIs, like the Google Maps API, follow the REST guidelines."
